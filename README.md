# GenAI-Projects
This repository contains my **_practical projects in Generative AI_**, covering **_AI-powered chatbots_**, **_text & image generation_**, and **_automation tools_**. All projects are implemented in **_Python, focusing on learning by building real-world applications_**.

I have created multipage Streamlit apps for interactive experiences, integrated Generative AI APIs like OpenAI, HuggingFace, and Google Gemini, and applied Machine Learning & Deep Learning techniques to solve practical problems.

**Skills & Tools Used**

1) Programming & Data: Python, NumPy, Pandas

2) AI & ML: Generative AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

3) Web & App Development: Streamlit, Flask for project demos

4) Version Control: Git & GitHub, daily iterative updates

5) Project Management: Multipage apps, modular structure, automated pipelines

This repo reflects my hands-on experience, continuous learning, and ability to deliver deployable AI solutions — perfect for recruiters and tech enthusiasts looking for real-world AI projects.
